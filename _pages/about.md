**探索智能的本质与构建未来决策系统~**
------
2021年本科毕业于齐鲁工业大学（山东省科学院），2024年硕士毕业于广西科技大学。2024年7月至2025年1月在中电科新型智慧城市研究院有限公司担任算法工程师。在国际会议AAMAS、期刊IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems、《计算机工程与应用》等上发表多篇论文，申请两项发明专利，已获授权三项软件著作权，持有中级软件设计师职业资格证书。研究方向涵盖多智能体系统智能决策、大模型与强化学习结合、具身智能等。

I graduated from Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences) in 2021, and graduated from Guangxi University of Science and Technology in 2024. Afterwards, I worked as an AI Engineer at the Smart City Research Institute Of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation from July 2024 to January 2025. Nowadays, I have published several papers in international conferences and jounals such as AAMAS, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Computer Engineering and Applications. I also have applied for two invention patents, and been granted three software copyrights. I hold an intermediate software designer professional qualification certificate. My research interests include intelligent decision-making of multi-agent systems, the combination of large language models and reinforcement learning, and embodied intelligence.

我坚信深入本源是理解一切的基石，So? 我常沉浸于那些经受时间洗礼、被誉为经典的著作——它们或许不总那么时髦，但其蕴含的智慧，往往出乎意料地深刻。科研的探索之旅，正是对知识理论最纯粹本质的追溯。这意味着需要我们穿过层层迷雾，才能找到真正的洞见，这些洞见的灵感，往往隐藏在经典之中。

Research Interests
======
我专注于构建能够自主决策、持续学习和高效协作的多智能体系统，值得一提的是，目前看来，它们还没有产生意识，因此，无需担心在执行任务的过程中，智能体会具有主观能动性，进行抱怨，并在内部产生存在危机。
1. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
2. LLM Agent
3. Embodied Intelligence
