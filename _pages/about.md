**探索智能的本质与构建未来决策系统~**
------
我是一位致力于多智能体智能决策、大模型与强化学习结合、具身智能的探索者。我的成果包括在AAMAS、IEEE T-ITS等顶会/期刊发表论文，并申领专利与软著，持有中级软件设计师职业资格证书。曾任中电科智慧院算法工程师。我坚信深入本源是理解一切的基石，So? 这常需要我沉浸于那些年代久远的经典著作——它们或许不总那么时髦，甚至有点“老派”，但其蕴含的智慧，往往出乎意料地深刻。科研的探索之旅，不正是对知识理论最纯粹本质的追溯嘛~这意味着我们需要穿过层层迷雾，才能找到真正的洞见，而灵感，往往就不合时宜地藏在那里。
I'm an explorer dedicated to intelligent decision-making for multi-agent systems, the fusion of large language models with reinforcement learning, and embodied intelligence. My achievements include publishing papers in top-tier conferences/journals like AAMAS and IEEE T-ITS, along with applying for patents and software copyrights. I also hold an intermediate software designer professional qualification certificate. I previously served as an AI Engineer at the Smart City Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation. I firmly believe that delving into the essence is the cornerstone of understanding everything. So? This often leads me to immerse myself in timeless, ancient classics – they might not always be fashionable, and perhaps even a bit "old-fashioned," but their wisdom is often unexpectedly profound. The journey of scientific research, isn't it precisely the purest pursuit of the fundamental essence of knowledge and theory~ This means we need to cut through layers of fog to find true insights, and inspiration, often, is unfashionably hidden right there.

Research Interests
======
我专注于构建能够自主决策、持续学习和高效协作的多智能体系统，值得一提的是，目前看来，它们还没有产生意识，因此，无需担心在执行任务的过程中，智能体会具有主观能动性，进行抱怨，并在内部产生存在危机。
